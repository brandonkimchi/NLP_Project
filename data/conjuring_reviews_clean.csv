"Here we go again 😭 another month I can't go to the toilet bymyself during night time ..."
"This is a perfect example of how you do a trailer. You're not getting a synopsis of the the entire movie. But it perfectly gives you a setting and a vibe that's a trailer."
"It doesn't matter if the movie gets flopped, keep producing horror movies from the conjuring universe, because we love the horror genre."
"My main fear is that this is the last time we'll see a movie based in 1986 in theatres ever again."
"Their chemistry is what keeps me coming back"
"I can't handle this, I don't want this ERA to End"
"“I don’t know how to protect you this time “ GOOSEBUMPS"
"this trailer was the whole movie tbh😂"
"No this cannot be the end of the franchise, we want more of conjuring movies even after this"
"0:26 Not the “based on a true story” 😬"
"I'm gonna miss The Conjuring man, I had so many memories watching this series since high school."
"Omg the Conjuring series will never ever be forgotten!! This is a series that made horror movies in the 2010 era the best!!"
"One of the most fascinating iconic horror series of all time"
"If you get goosebumps just from the trailer, imagine what you'll feel when you watch the movie. Thank you to everyone who has contributed to this amazing franchise."
"The Conjuring: Last Rites ❌"
"Moving the furniture ✅"
"This franchise is great. No corny jokes, just pure love and sacrifice. The visuals are amazing and so meaningful. These movies explore themes of family, death, love, resilience, and bravery. Honestly, 10 out of 10."
"I live in Connecticut. The Warrens are legends here. They’d be so happy people are still making movies about them."
"Conjuring made me realize that CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE by Elvis Presley is not a romantic song. Thank You 🖤💀"
"End Of An Era"
"Vera farmiga and Patrick Wilson thank you for being in Conjuring Franchise so far without you these would be incomplete"
"The conjuring series will always remain unparalleled. The best horror in ages."
"I just love how protective Ed is of his wife. It's absolutely adorable. The Conjuring series might be hella frightening, but it's also a love story and there's always a happy ending. That is what I love the most."
"What’s the most scariest to me is this franchise ending"
"my brother worked in this!"
"12 years of the Conjuring Universe Thank you!"
"man i so love this franchise, i wished they continue this for life"
"vera and patrick, what a great duo. whatever horror you make, i'll be there"
"NGL it was a pretty good movie"
"I can't live without this franchise. I just can't. Vera and Patrick, thank you both so so much for portraying the GREATEST and most LEGENDARY paranormal investigators that ever walked the earth."
"I'm not crying that this is ending, you are"
"vera farmiga and patrick wilson are such phenomenal actors; can’t believe this is the last time we’re seeing them in the conjuringverse"
"RIP THE ERA OF CONJURING"
"Vera farmiga and Patrick Wilson were born to play this roles ❣️😢"
"Vera and Patrick are just magical on screen!!"
"Gonna miss them so much 😢 👻"
"I think it’s fair to say that The Conjuring anthology has been one of the greatest of our time. So many movie nights & memories made."
"This is a memory of The Conjuring film; the ending keeps coming back to me. ❤😭"
"An iconic era of horror is ending and I'm not ready. 😢❤"
"The Conjuring was the first horror movie I ever watched and it still remains my favourite. It's disheartening that the series has to end, but I'm happy that it's ending while it still has its glory. Looking forward to this one!"
"Truly the END OF AN ERA"
"Ive been watching these movies with my brother well before i was even old enough to watch them, and now that the final one is here I CANNOT WAIT."
"This was the scariest movie I have ever seen, and I have seen them all. I have never in all my years seen a final movie in a series be better than all of its previous installments. They knocked it out of the park."
"I have been a horror movie buff since the 1980s, and this was legit phenomenal."
"This series should never be ended 😢 I have memories with this"
"Thank you CONJURING TEAM for Frightening us over the years. This might be last film but our love for the franchise will be forever. VERA and PATRICK on screen chemistry will forever be remembered. Thank you JAMES WAN, Michael Chaves and Warner Bros❤ RIP to the legends Ed and Lorraine Warren."
"Miss me? - Sherlock is officially in the Conjuring universe"
"Such a boring film it was..Very disappointing...C2 was a masterpiece"
"Vera farmiga and patrick wilson are such an underrated hollywood reel couple who doesnt get enough credit for their chemistry"
"Applause to them for giving such a terrific conjuring series"
"I LOVE that they put the same music from the first movie"
"As a person from Pennsylvania, I feel very excited to see this come September. This one feels very different because “It hits home”…"
"Just watched it - it was fun and spooky, but I don't get why they stopped. POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD nothing overly dramatic happens at the end that could possibly make them go yep this isn't it, we're gonna call it quits, in fact everyone lives happily ever after. Trailer makes it seem like it's the opposite - something so screwed up happened that it made them abandon their career as demonologists. But nothing happened? lol"
"I’m so here for the love people are finally showing the conjuring movies!! I feel like lots of people around me have turned their nose up on these movies and didn’t appreciate them enough, but with this final installment it’s nice to see people acc upset it’s over and feel nostalgic"
